            <p>
                Ninnu first day choosi anukunna yay! oka telugu girl class ki vachindhi ani IDK why I thought that ur telugu. Later, I realised that ur from Karnataka. Appudu anukunna ok karnataka is also beside no problem. Not like other girls look so decent and innocent (at starting&#128514;). Eppudu kuda decent and innocent in some cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actual ga freshers ki dance cheyyali ani na mind lo ledhu but kishan vachi sudden ga adigadu so nen ok ani cheppina IDK why i told suddenly he came and asked that girls kuda dance chestharu anta annadu then I was thinking that nake dance radhu girls tho ela chesthano ani chinna tension unde IDK but sudden ga fix ayipoyam chedham ani anukunnam kadha?
            </p>
            <p>
                Eka manam practice start chesam. After knowing girls are also dancing others are also intrested and they also came to join. Next when we actually decided songs and theme vishwa came into the picture he started telling if u both become pair it will be good. But, I was like no she may not feel comfortable with me kishan is karnataka and she is also so they can be comfortable. But vishwa was like u both looks good u should only get pair with her
            </p>
            <p>
                At that time my mind was in two states. One is telling that u don't know anything about love and how to treat girls. So, just concentrate on studies and just go. But by saying no no no for myself automatically fell into u.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we become a bit close we started flirting at that moment I felt like we are already in loveüíñ. But some of ur sentences will take me back like I will be in the same way with my other male friends and other sentence I will also flirt with other friends. So, then I will say to myself that ok be normal.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the middle u started saying kishan that u r feeling comfortable with us and mentioned my name multiple times so these guys started saying the things like propose her she also have soft corner on u etc., But i was like shut up she told casually nothing more than that.
            </p>
            <p>
                After days pass we started knowing each other wait wait wait lets go back few frames on the day befor freshers I told u to text after reaching that was the initiation right(now tell who initiated first&#128527;). On the day of freshers u look so pretty in that outfit so because of my eyes u got something is there&#128517;. After few days we started knowing each other. After knowing all about u I felt like I should see always smile on ur face and i should be the reason. So, I decided and i started telling all possitive even though by knowing about ur parents and my parents I started telling don't think about future those kinda things etc,. Later I made u cry many time but this is a proposal so I won't talk about those things&#128521;.
